# rexplorer
A small utility for fixing annoyances with windows explorer and sleep mode.

## Purpuse
This small utility provides a quick shortcut for restarting the **explorer.exe** app running on your Windows installation.
This can be particulary useful, if you have disappearing icons after waking your computer from sleep.

## Installation
Dowload the installer from the [Relases](https://github.com/kalmanba/rexplorer/releases/tag/v1.0.0_rexplorer) tab in github, and run the installer. Make sure to leave the create desktop icon checked.
You can also just download the source code, but be sure to set the required paths manually.

## Usage
Click the shortcut on your desktop, and wait for explorer to restart. After that you should be good to go.
